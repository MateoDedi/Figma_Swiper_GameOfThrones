From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised alongside Eddard's lawful children at Winterfell. Jon's true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself, in order to protect him from those that sought the complete annihilation of House Targaryen.</p>

                            During Robert's Rebellion, Jaime killed Aerys Targaryen, earning the derogatory nickname "Kingslayer." He was pardoned by Robert and allowed to serve in his Kingsguard. Following King Robert's death, he was appointed as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard to his son, Joffrey.</p>

                        <p>King Joffrey I Baratheon was the eighteenth king to rule from the Iron Throne and the second king of the Baratheon dynasty. Though believed by most to be the eldest son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, Joffrey is actually a bastard born from Cersei's incestuous relationship with her twin brother Jaime Lannister. He is the older brother of Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon.

                            Joffrey's reckless decision to execute Ned Stark on false charges of treason ignited the War of the Five Kings.</p>
